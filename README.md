Homework from the Systems Science graduate program

"Monty Hall" was a game show where contestants chose one of three doors; one of the doors concealed a prize. Monty, the host, 
would open one of the other doors to reveal a goat, and give the contestant the option of staying with their first choice
or switching to the other closed door. 
This program can run a large number of simulations of the game to illustrate that the odds of winning are increased
when the contestant switches.

"Rule 250" is one of Stephen Wolfram's elementary cellular automaton rules. As follows: if a cell is flanked by two white cells, 
the cell beneath it in the grid turns white. Otherwise, the cell beneath it turns black. (Represented here as '0' for white
and '1' for black.) This creates a checkerboard-patterned triangle.

"Quadratic A and B" was used as a module in a systems dynamic project, tracking rates of change when varying constants and time spans, similar to the background code in Stella or Vinsim modeling software.
